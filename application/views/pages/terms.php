a. If edubuy establishes any limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay edubuy ninety nine euros (€99) for (i) each message posted in excess of such limits or (ii) for each day on which you access edubuy in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.

d. If you use edubuy e-mail addresses or computer systems to send unsolicited e-mail advertisements to edubuy e-mail addresses or any other party, you agree to pay edubuy thirty euros (€30) for each such e-mail.
e. If you post messages in violation of these Terms, other than as described above, you agree to pay edubuy ninety nine euros (€99) for each such message.
